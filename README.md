<p align="left">Unity Version: 6000.0.30.f1<br>Packages: Input System<br>3D Models: Free models from Sketchfab<br>Musics: Free from Pixabay<br>Musics converted to Wav with convert-online.com and compressed with freeconvert.com.</p>

<p align="left">this game designed in 3D Top-Down while It's fit with the scenario.<br><br>Player can see a room which includes a kid character and 3 objects.<br>player is able to control kid with "WASD" to move around and interact with objects. movement implemented with Unity's Input system.</p>

<h2 align="left">Interactable Objects</h2>

###

<p align="left">each object include a "IInteractable" interface which gives them the ability of doing something when interacting with a character.<br>So the character can stand near an  interactable object to trigger with object's collider box, then character will found that It's triggering with a Interactable object. also character will tell "InteractionPrompt_Text" to show It self. this text appears a "Press E to interact" near the Interactable object.<br><br>each objects response to interact:<br>Musical bear: play a music<br>Desk: show stories<br>Lamp: lighting up</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Character State</h2>

###

<p align="left">Kid character have 2 {calm, sad} states. player can change them using UI buttons.<br><br>thanks to state and strategy patterns, both character's behavior and other objects behavior will be different in each character's states.<br>Character moving speed will be different in each state. <br>In purpose to make interactables understand character state I didn't used a direct access from interactables to character, instead I relied on abstraction.<br>while an interactable is doing something (like when the lamp is on) and player changes character state without turning off anyhting, then an event comes to tell observers to update their behvior (in lamp case, lamp will changes light color), in this way I tried to avoid breaking the game with changing states while an interactable is doing something.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">API Service</h2>

###

<p align="left">there is stories.json file in "Resources/Data" includes stories data.<br><br>in this case we a 3 layer architecture, a consumer which is the interactable object "Desk" responsible to tell APIService to retrieve stories and  give them to UI Panel. API Service layer is a singleton responsible to fetch data asynchronously, I added a test delay to see that game does not freeze. and the last layer is presentation layer which is the UI and the only job of this layer is to show them.</p>
